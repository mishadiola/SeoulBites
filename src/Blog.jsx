            <p>
              Seoul Bites is inspired by my love for Korean food and digital
              creativity. I wanted to merge design, coding, and storytelling
              into one project. What better way than to create an e-commerce
              platform where Korean flavors meet modern design?

            <h2>üíª The Process</h2>
            <p>
              The journey began with sketches and mood boards. I carefully
              selected fonts, colors, and layouts that would give the brand an
              authentic yet modern Korean aesthetic. Then I moved to development
              with <strong>React</strong>, building pages like Home, Menu,
              Contact, and the Shopping Cart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the way, I encountered challenges with styling, responsive
              layouts, and cart logic. Debugging was tough, but every hurdle
              taught me new tricks in CSS and React.

            <p>
              This project taught me not only coding but also patience, design
              thinking, and problem-solving. I realized creating something
              meaningful takes time, creativity, and persistence. Every bug
              fixed and every design choice refined brought Seoul Bites closer
              to life.

              Seoul Bites is just the beginning. My goal is to keep enhancing
              the site‚Äîintegrating a payment system, a customer profile, login
              and Sign Up, and a full admin dashboard. This journey excites me
